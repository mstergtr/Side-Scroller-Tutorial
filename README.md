# Side-Scroller-Tutorial

This is a simple side scrolling 2D space shooter designed for teaching children game design and coding. I have used this in the past to demonstrate various concepts including a transform translation based controller, dealing/receiving damage, a spawn system, etc. Efforts have been made to make the code relatively simple while following general clean code principles.

The project makes use of artwork from the Warped Space Shooter asset (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/warped-space-shooter-181590).
